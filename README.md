# Decision-Tree-Classifier-Implementation
This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier using Python to perform supervised learning and interpret model decisions visually. The notebook walks through data preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, and performance evaluation, highlighting how decision trees split data based on information gain and Gini impurity.
